Overview

AIM

This app will act as a caretaker for a mother to be. From taking care of her routine doctor visits, medical checkups, keeping track of her medicines to ensuring that she remains positive and strong during her 9-month long journey.

BRIEF

The app will contain a feature wherein the mother can upload the prescription of medicines, can set reminders of the regular checkups she needs to go through and some routine activities. The app will remind her of all the things. 
Also, the app will suggest some good articles to read during pregnancy, links to the videos of Yoga exercises that are good for health or certain meditation techniques that can help her stay positive and happy.
The app will also help the user to stay connected with her doctor and family and will also act as  a helper in emergency situations.

IMPACT WE WISH TO CREATE

We want this app to make the pregnancy period of a woman happier. We aim at providing the ‘Mommy to Be’ overall a pleasant experience with the app.    






Project Specification and Work Distribution


The app will be designed with an easy to use  and pleasing user interface.               (Loveleen)

It will comprise of various features,


Planner                                        (Parth)
    
The app would have an inbuilt Calendar. It would be visible by months (standard) and by trimester and week count. Calendar will store information about Doctor appointments, time to take/restock medicines. The app would store the prescriptions for the latter. Calendar will also allow the user to add notes about symptoms or general things the user would like to share with their doctor. This information can then directly be shared with their doctor.

Diary                                                               (Kartik)    

The app would have a diary feature that will allow the user to store written diary entries, photos and videos which will then be accessible by date and type (ex all photos).There will also be a special feature to allow the user create a journey video after the pregnancy. There will also be a feature to export the diary to be stored.

Chat                                                    (Parth and Kartik)

The app will allow the user to chat with other users. For users to connect with each other, every user will have code. If another user enters that code, the two will be able to chat with each other.

//Feed                                                    (Kartik)

In the feed section there will be timely pregnancy related articles , whose frequency will be customisable. Also it will include meditation music, yoga exercises, etc for the user.

Emergency                                           (Loveleen)

In any state of emergency, the user can initiate an emergency call which will be visible to the partner and doctors. Anyone in proximity with the mother can attend to her.



      (This is not the design but the Pictorial depiction of the functionalities.)






The app will allow the user to connect with other users and have them as different roles.
(Parth and Kartik)


Partner
         
The app would have a special partner domain that will allow the user’s partner to register and view all the details.The user can sync her account with her partner and she can decide to allow the partner to manage things like Doctor appointments and medicine restocking, freeing the user from such burdens.

Doctor
         
The app would also allow the user to add doctors. Doctors won’t have access to any details automatically but would be able to chat with the user. The user can share anything they want with them (ex. Their symptoms and medical notes from the Planner, expected due date, photos, etc. ).

Friends        

The app would also allow the user to add friends. Friends won’t have access to any details but would be able to chat with the user. The user can share anything they want with them (ex. Their diary, photos and videos, etc. ).
